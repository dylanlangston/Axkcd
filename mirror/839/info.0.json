The chessboard is mounted on rockets and appears to be flying through the air.]]\nBa3: Mission Control, come in.  This is Ba3 on the capsule calling Ke5 on the home board.  We\u0027re on track and approaching the Coast of Catan.  Our ETA is --\nNc3: Control, this is Nc3. Bishop put all our food in the center so I can\u0027t get it. I demand --\nBa3: Control, knight will get his food back when he stops hopping around bragging about how comfy the black squares are.  I swear to God, I\u0027m \nthis\n close to capturing him and completing the mission alone.\n{{Title text: We\u0027re going to have to work together to get over our hangups if we\u0027re going to learn to move on Catan\u0027s hexagonal grid. It\u0027s bad enough that we lost our crew of pawns when we passed within firing range of Battleship.}}",
