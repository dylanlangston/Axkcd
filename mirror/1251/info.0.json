Did you make this glasses attachment?\nBlack hat guy {{through door}}: Oh, yeah. \n\n[[Black hat guy is sitting at his laptop.]]\nPolice officer: What\u0027s it do? \nBlack hat guy: It detects when someone near you is wearing Google Glass and shines a laser pointer at their eyepiece.\nPolice officer: Why??\nBlack hat guy: The best defense is an indiscriminate offense. \n\n[[Cut back to officers outside the apartment.]]\nMale officer: It seems you\u0027ve mailed these devices to people across Silicon Valley, including the children of every Google executive. \nBlack hat guy: Yeah. It\u0027s a viral marketing campaign for an upcoming movie. \n\nMale officer: What movie?\nBlack hat guy: haven\u0027t decided yet.
