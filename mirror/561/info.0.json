The standard histories are urban legends.\n[[Just the couple remain; the boyfriend throws another coin in]] Well: You\u0027ve never said \u0022I love you\u0022 and meant it. It was always just words.\n[[The girlfriend now throws in a coin]] Well: You meant it every time.\n{{title text: I\u0027ll concede ergonomics anecdotally, but none of the studies of Dvorak were at all rigorous (the most-cited Navy study was overseen by Dvorak himself), and QWERTY had a lot of fair competition.  And the \u0027slow typists down\u0027 thing is basically a myth.  Also EMACS RULES WOOOOOOO!}}",
