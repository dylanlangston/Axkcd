Only.. you aren\u0027t even frickin\u0027 sure because of this terrible kerning, as the \u0022C\u0022 and the \u0022I\u0022 in \u0022CITY\u0022 have waaay too strong kerning. And so do the \u0022C\u0022 and the \u0022E\u0022 in \u0022OFFICES\u0022, to the point that it actually looks like TWO words.  And the I and the C are so close together, they almost look like a freakish K!  Two people stand in front of this sign. One notices all these obvious flaws, while the other exists in peaceful ignorance.]]\nPerson 1: *Argh*!\nPerson 2: what?\nIf you really hate someone, teach them to recognize bad kerning.\n\n{{Title text: I have never been as self-conscious about my handwriting as when I was inking in the caption for this comic.}}",
