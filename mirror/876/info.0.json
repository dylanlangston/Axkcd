I\u0027m trapped!\nPerson: It\u0027s dark and I can\u0027t see anything except these two distorted splotches of light!\nPerson: Help!\n\n[[The 911 operator is in an office, wearing a headset.]]\nOperator: Splotches of light? Your ... eyeballs?\nPerson (over phone): I think that\u0027s what they are! There\u0027s meat everywhere!\n\nOperator: ... so you\u0027re a brain.\nPerson (over phone): Yes!\nOperator: Yeah, we all are. You\u0027re not trapped. Use your body to walk around and experience reality.\n\nPerson: But everything\u0027s just signals in my sensory cortices! How can I be sure they correspond to an external world?!\nOperator (over phone): I\u0027m sorry, but we can\u0027t send a search-and-rescue team into Plato\u0027s cave.\n\n{{Title text: Socrates could\u0027ve saved himself a lot of trouble if he\u0027d just brought a flashlight, tranquilizer gun, and a bunch of rescue harnesses.}}",
