  "transcript": "[[Dark scene shown, with man and girl sitting in the moonlight let in by the only window.]]\nMegan and I first met at a party at her sister\u0027s.\nWe hit it off, opened up, shared secrets, and talked about everything. Around us, the party waned, but we hid from sleep together, talking through the deepest hours of the night.\nThe dawn found us curled up on a couch, asleep but still together.\nThat experience, connecting with a stranger and falling recklessly in love is one of life\u0027s greatest joys.\nAnd now that you\u0027re married, you\u0027ll never experience it again.\nIt\u0027s the price you pay for everlasting love. It\u0027s a small one, but I hope it stings a little.\nAnyway, I wish you and Megan the best. \n...Hey, man, you ASKED me to do a toast.\n{{title text: Oh, huh, so you didn\u0027t know that story?]]",
