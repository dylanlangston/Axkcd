Probably.\n\nParent: What!? Why!?\nTeenager Because all my friends did. Think about it - which scenario is more likely: \n\nTeenager: Every single person I know, many of them levelheaded and afraid of heights, abruptly went crazy at exactly the same time... ... or the bridge is on fire? \n\nParent: ... I, uh... hmm. \nTeenager: Imagine reading this on CNN: \u0022Many fled their vehicles and jumped from the bridge. Those who stayed behind...\u0022 Is something good about to happen to those people? \nParent: Maybe they\u0027ll find cookies? \nTeenager: OK, *you* stay. I\u0027m jumping. \n\n{{Title text: And it says a lot about you that when your friends jump off a bridge en masse, your first thought is apparently \u0027my friends are all foolish and I won\u0027t be like them\u0027 and not \u0027are my friends ok?\u0027.}}",
