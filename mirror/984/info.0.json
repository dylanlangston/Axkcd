Finally, rockets that improve on the ones we had 40 years ago.\nBlack Hat Man: Are we getting Nazis to build those ones too?\n\nPerson 1, offscreen: What?\nBlack Hat Man, offscreen: When we first captured von Braun and his team, we had our engineers interview them, then *we* built the rockets.  But our rockets kept exploding\n[[von Braun interviewed by a scientist while under guard]]\n[[The same scientist in front of a spectacularly exploding rocket]]\n\nBlack Hat Man, narrating: Eventually we gave up and had the German teams do it, and they built us the Saturn V moon rocket.  \n[[The Saturn V gracefully arcing across the night sky]]\n\nPerson 1: I\u0027m.. not sure what lesson to take from that.\nBlack Hat Man: \u0022If you want something done right ,learning from the Nazis isn\u0027t enough.
