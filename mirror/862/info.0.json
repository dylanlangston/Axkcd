Do news stories so affect my life that I benefit from checking them more than once a day?\n\n[[shutdown screen]]\nLuke (thinking): I should at least check Faceb... no.  Screw it.  I can\u0027t do my job when I\u0027m distracting myself every five minutes like this.\n\n[[two people before a battlefield screen]]\nGuy: His computer\u0027s off.  Luke - You\u0027ve switched off your targeting computer. What\u0027s wrong?\nLuke: Nothing. I\u0027m all right.\n\n{{Title text: After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn\u0027t do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically vanished--and my \u0027productive\u0027 computer use was unaffected.}}",
