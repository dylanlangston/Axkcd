The man in black hat is sitting across from a girl]]\nMain in black hat (narrating): I glance up and wait for her to make eye contact, then look down bashfully and, if I can, blush.\n[[Scene back to original room with man and man in black hat]]\nMan in black hat: Then, when I see her start to smile at me, I roll my eyes and hit her with a quick glare, then resume writing.  The alienation stays with her all day.  It\u0027s great.\n[[Man in black hat is back to typing on the computer]]\nMan: You\u0027re sickening.  This is why we can\u0027t have nice people\nMan in black hat: I can\u0027t help it. It\u0027s like shooting lonely, angsty fish in a barrel.\n{{title text: And the journal is filled with all the things I\u0027d say to her if I were nice like you.  I burn it when it\u0027s full.}}",
