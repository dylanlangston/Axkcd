  "transcript": "((Everything is one big panel.))\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum\n\nThese waves travel through the electromagnetic field. They were formerly carried by the aether, which was decommissioned in 1897 due to budget cuts.\n\nOther waves:\n- Slinky waves [[Two people hold the ends of a tangled slinky.]]\n- Sound waves [[There is a snippet of a frequency band. Between 20 Hz and 20 KHz is labeled \u0022Audible Sound.\u0022 Towards the top is a line labeled \u0022That high-pitched noise in empty rooms.\u0022]]\n- The wave [[A row of people does a wave.]]\n\n[[Three parallel scales are across the bottom. The first is lambda (m), ranging from 100Mm to 100fm; second is f (Hz), which starts at 1 Hz and reaches 100 THz about 2\n3 of the way along, after which the labels read \u0022other entertaining greek prefixes like peta- exa- and zappa-\u0022; last is Q (Gal^2\nColoumb), whose labels are 17, 117, pi, 17, 42, theta, e^pi-pi, -2, 540^50, and 11^2. Above the scales and lined up accurately with the first two are the following:]]\n\n- Power \u0026 Telephone (100Mm to 1km)\n- Radio \u0026 TV (1km to somewhere between 1m and 10cm); above that are many boxes showing subranges (AM, VHF, UHF, 14\n7 NPR pledge drives, a very thin band for the space rays controlling Steve Ballmer, 99.3 \u0022The Fox,\u0022 101.5 \u0022The Badger,\u0022 106.3 \u0022The Frightened Squirrel,\u0022 cell phone cancer rays, CIA, ham radio, kosher radio, shouting car dealership commercials)\n- Microwaves (a bit more than 10cm to a bit more than 1mm); it also has subranges (aliens, just below SETI, wifi, FHF, brain waves, sulawesi, gravity)\n- Toasters (about 1mm to about 100 micrometers)\n- IR (about 100 micrometers to somewhere between 1 micrometer and 1 nm); above that is a bell graph labeled \u0022Superman\u0027s heat vision,\u0022 with a motorcycle driving up the left side labeled \u0022Jack Black\u0027s Heat Vision.\u0022\n- Visible light (and, under it, visible dark); above that is a bell graph labeled \u0022sunlight.\u0022 There\u0027s a breakout chart above it showing the visible spectrum from 700nm (red) to 450nm (violet). There\u0027s an arrow pointing to where octarine would be, somewhere off to the side. Above that are bars showing the absorption spectra for hyrogen, helium, Depends(R) (yellow only) and Tampax(R) (red only).\n- UV (about 100nm to about 10nm)\n- Miller Light (a thin bar around 10nm)\n- An unlabeled section with a thin line above it showing the frequency of the main death star laser\n- A blocked-off portion labeled \u0022Censored Under Patriot Act.\u0022\n- X-rays (from about 1nm to about 10pm); a line above shows the frequency of mail-order x-ray glasses. Somewhere vaguely above the 10pm mark is a potato.\n- Gamma\ncosmic rays (10pm and smaller); above that is a bar marked Sinister Google Projects which also trails off into higher frequencies, and blogorays, which are slightly lower.\n\n{{Title text: Sometimes I try to picture what everything would look like if the whole spectrum were compressed into the visible spectrum.
