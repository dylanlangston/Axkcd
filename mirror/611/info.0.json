  "transcript": "[[A woman is watching TV.  The Black Hat Guy is leaning on the back of her chair.]]\nWoman: I\u0027ve realized that I always secretly root for hurricanes. I watch the news hoping that they\u0027ll get really big and hit a city. I know my hopes don\u0027t actually affect it, but I feel bad.\n\nBlack Hat Guy: Nah, that\u0027s just natural human attraction to spectacle. It\u0027s like watching the shuttle launch because you don\u0027t want to miss it if there\u0027s a disaster.\nWoman: ... I guess?\n\nBlack Hat Guy: Or dressing as an intern to sneak into operating rooms, in case a patient dies and you can watch them harvest organs.\nWoman: Wait, you \ndo\n that?\n\nBlack Hat Guy:  Or stealing detour signs to direct highway drivers downw backwoods roads strewn with caltrops. After the tires burst, you start shooting out their windows.\n\nBlack Hat Guy: Then, when they flee the car in terror, you hunt them on horseback, like \nmen\n once did.\nWoman: I realized a while back that we\u0027re having entirely different conversations.\n\n{{Title text: Hurricane forums are full of excited comments about central pressure and wind speed and comparisons to Camille and 1931 and 1938, with hastily-tacked-on notes about how it will be tragic if anyone dies and they hope it\u0027s a dud.}}",
