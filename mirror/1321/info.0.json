So much for global warming, huh?\n\u003C\u003CBlack Hat sighs\u003E\u003E\nBlack Hat: This used to happen all the time.\nWhite Hat: What?\n\n[[A picture of an x-y plot, with years from 1970 to 2014 along the x-axis and dots rising up for each year, mostly concentrated from 1970 to 1999. The plot is labeled \u0022Days with lows \u003C 0\u00B0F\u0022.]]\nBlack Hat: You\u0027re from St. Louis, right? On average, it used to get below 0\u00B0F there a handful of days per year. But you haven\u0027t had a day like that since the nineties.\n\n[[The two figures continue walking.]]\nBlack Hat: Then, in 2014, when the first polar vortex hit, it dipped below zero for two days. And everyone freaked out because what used to be normal now feels too cold.\nWhite Hat: It is too cold!\n\n[[Panel labeled \u0022The future:\u0022 contains a generic figure, looking at a frozen puddle on the ground.]]\nFigure: Look at this - ice!
