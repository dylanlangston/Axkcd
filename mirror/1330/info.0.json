People say that\u0027s why the miners sealed the well and abandoned the project.\n\n[[The woman turns back to her laptop.]]\nBlack hat guy: Why would anyone believe that story? \nWoman: I guess some people think Hell is literally an underground place. \n\n[[Black hat guy turns around and addresses the woman.]]\nBlack hat guy: No - I mean, why would the miners seal the opening? Why not just dig a canal connecting it to the ocean? Unless they like Hell.\n\n[[The woman turns back around.]]\nWoman: ... If there\u0027s ever a war between earth and Hell, I hope I\u0027m on your side. \nBlack hat guy: You seem nice; you probably won\u0027t be. \n\n{{Title text: Tonight\u0027s top story: Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness, died in his home this morning at the age of [unintelligible rune].
