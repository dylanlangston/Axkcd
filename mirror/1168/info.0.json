The two people are shouting off-screen.]]\nWoman: Rob! You use Unix! \nMan: Come quick! \n\n[[The woman, man, and Rob look at the screen. Rob peers closely. The screen reads: \nTo disarm the bomb, simply enter a valid tar command on your first try. No Googling. You have TEN seconds. \n~# _ ]]\n\n[[They continue to peer.]]\n\nMan: ... Rob? \nRob: I\u0027m so sorry. \n\n{{Title text: I don\u0027t know what\u0027s worse--the fact that after 15 years of using tar I still can\u0027t keep the flags straight, or that after 15 years of technological advancement I\u0027m still mucking with tar flags that were 15 years old when I started.}}",
