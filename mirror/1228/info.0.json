Prometheus is looking ponderous and holding a flaming torch.]]\nFigure A: Prometheus has stolen fire from the Gods! \nPrometheus: Well, sort of. I mean, when you use a fire to make another fire, the first fire doesn\u0027t go away. So really, it\u0027s more like sharing.\nFire wants to be free.\n\n{{Title text: \u0027I\u0027m here to return what Prometheus stole.\u0027 would be a good thing to say if you were a fighter pilot in a Michael Bay movie where for some reason the world\u0027s militaries had to team up to defeat every god from human mythology, and you\u0027d just broken through the perimeter and gotten a missile lock on Mount Olympus.}}",
