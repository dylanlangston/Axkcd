A group of other people are in the background behind them.]]\nHost: Welcome to Stargazing, with your host, me. I\u0027m a doctor or whatever.\n\n[[She continues to talk.]]\nHost: I\u0027m not gonna waste your time on the shitty stars. Just the good tuff. Honestly half of \u0027em just look like dots.\n\n((Normal color panel - black on white))\n[[A shot from far away of the host standing in the center of the group of people watching her, she points to the sky.]]\nHost: This is Sirius. It\u0027s the brightest star in our sky so it\u0027s in charge. It\u0027s really two stars, but one of them is barely even trying. This is Andromeda. It\u0027s too big to think about, so let\u0027s not.\n\n((Inverse color panel))\n[[Close-up on the host gesturing toward the sky behind her.]]\nHost: That red star is Betelgeuse. It\u0027s gonna explode someday. Can\u0027t happen soon enough, as far as I\u0027m concerned. I-- \nHOLY SHIT DID YOU SEE THAT METEOR?!?!\n Space is \nawesome!\n\n\n[[The host speaks to someone out of panel.]]\nOther: Are you \nsure\n you\u0027re an astronomer?\nHost: People keep asking that, so I finally tried to look that word up in a dictionary, and \nwow\n is that book ever boring. No \nthank\n you.\nOther: But--\nHost: \nSPACE!\n\n\n{{Title text: Some of you may be thinking, \u0027But wait, isn\u0027t the brightest star in our sky the Sun?\u0027 I think that\u0027s a great question and you should totally ask it. On the infinite tree of possible conversations spread out before us, I think that\u0027s definitely the most promising branch.}}",
