  "transcript": "A man stands at a blackboard covered in equations and diagrams, an open laptop and scattered paper at his feet. His fists are balled in anger and there is a little angry squiggle over his head. A second man stands behind him, arms out in a shrug.\n((Words in \u003C\u003E are gray.))\nSecond man: You\u0027re trying to predict the behavior of \u003Ccomplicated system\u003E? Just model it as a \u003Csimple object\u003E, and then add some secondary terms to account for \u003Ccomplications I just thought of\u003E. -- Easy, right? -- So, why does \u003Cyour field\u003E need a whole journal, anyway?\nLiberal-arts majors may be annoying sometimes, but there\u0027s \nnothing\n more obnoxious than a physicist first encountering a new subject.\n\n{{Title text: If you need some help with the math, let me know, but that should be enough to get you started! Huh? No, I don\u0027t need to read your thesis, I can imagine roughly what it says.}}",
