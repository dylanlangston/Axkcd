Rex\n is more closely related to sparrows than to \nStegosaurus\n. \n\n[[A cladistic tree showing a single origin point which branches on one to a second point which branches into  \u0022\nStegosaurus\n\u0022 and \u0022\nTriceratops\n\u0022, and on the other side branches into a second point which branches into \u0022\nT. Rex\n\u0022 and \u0022sparrow\u0022. Each label\u0027s vertical distance from the origin point  represents \u0022separation by time\u0022, the Steogsaurus being closest, the Triceratops and T. Rex on the same level in the middle, and \u0022sparrow\u0022 furthest. The distance of their label from their closest common relative represent \u0022phylogenetic distance\u0022. Below this tree are sketches of a Stegosaurus, T. Rex, and sparrow skeleton. A box surrounds the T. Rex and sparrow skeletons, showing they are physically similar.]]\n\nBirds aren\u0027t \ndescended\n from dinosaurs, they \nare\n dinosaurs.\n\nWhich means the fastest animal alive today is a small carnivorous dinosaur, \nFalco peregrinus\n. \n[[A silhouette of a falcon flying toward a smaller prey bird.]]\nIt preys mainly on other dinosaurs, which it strikes and kills in midair with its claws.\n\nThis is a good world.\n\n{{Title text: Sure, T. rex is closer in height to Stegosaurus than a sparrow. But that doesn\u0027t tell you much; \u0027Dinosaur Comics\u0027 author Ryan North is closer in height to certain dinosaurs than to the average human.}}",
