You can\u0027t bring her back.\nSecond Man: But I have to, she\u0027s a part of my life.\nFirst Man: \u003C\u003Csigh\u003E\u003E\nFirst Man: Okay, let me put this in your terms.\nFirst Man: Remember when Aeris died in FFVII? It was sad, but you had to keep playing.\nSecond Man: Actually, I downloaded a mod to add her back to my party. It changed other character\u0027s appearances and dialogue to hers so you didn\u0027t have to lose her.\nSecond Man: Lots of gamers did it.\n[[The first man put his hand on his chin]]\nFirst Man: That is troubling on several levels.\nSecond Man: I wonder if Maggie\u0027s old dress would fit you.\n{{alt text: It\u0027s bad enough that all the families in your Sims are just you and Maggie recreated over and over.}}",
