  "transcript": "Man: Yes, from the evidence it looks pretty likely to me that we\u0027re causing global warming on a horrific scale.  But with science you don\u0027t need to argue.  It doesn\u0027t matter who wins the debate -- it\u0027s about reality.  By just waiting a little longer, we\u0027ll get to SEE who was right.  It feels unethical but I find myself wanting to keep quiet about the science just to know for sure.  As terrible as it sounds, the state of the world isn\u0027t really my responsibility.  I\u0027m just thrilled to get to watch.  If the scientists are right -- and if we keep people from understanding just a little longer -- we\u0027ll enjoy quite a ride.  And pragmatically, on the outside chance that they\u0027re all wrong, I get saved the embarrassment of having spoken up.\n{{alt: There are so many well-meaning conservatives around here who just assume global warming is only presented as a moral issue for political reasons.}}",
