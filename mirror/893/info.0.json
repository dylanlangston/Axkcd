The line of the graph has a bracket above it that says \u002765 Years\u0027, starting at 1969, ending in 2034. \n\nThe line starts at 1969 and increases steeply to 12 by 1972. It then plateaus until the early nineties declines gradually to 8 between 1991-1999, and then plateaus again.\n\nFrom 2020-2035, which is labeled \u0027Projected Actuarial Tables\u0027, the line branches into three and begins to decline more steeply to zero. The area between the first and second branch is shaded and labeled \u00275th percentile\u0027 and the area between the second and third branch is shaded and labeled \u002795th percentile.\u0027]] \n\n{{Title text: The universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there\u0027s no good reason to go into space--each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision.}}",
