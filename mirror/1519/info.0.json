  "transcript": "[[A teacher holding a pointer stands in front of a backdrop of a lush, coastal field filled with flower and greenhouses.]]\nTeacher: Venus was once temperate. It had seas and rivers, and Venusians cultivated vast fields of beautiful flowers.\n\n[[The backdrop is now a shot of an earth-like Venus seen from space, with greenhouses flying rapidly away from it.]]\nTeacher: Until their greenhouses fled the planet due to the runaway greenhouse effect.\n\n[[A little girl is seen sitting at a desk, listening to the teacher speak.]]\nTeacher: The Venusians pursued their greenhouses to Earth, settling in the Netherlands and kickstarting the Dutch floral industry. Any questions?\n\n[[A close-up on the teacher\u0027s profile, the student is out of panel.]]\nStudent: Because you\u0027re retiring in a month, do you just not care what you say anymore? \nTeacher: \nWHAT?!\n I \nRIDE THE SKIES\n atop a screaming bird of truth! Also, yes, I do not. \n\n{{Title text: The sudden introduction of Venusian flowers led to an explosive growth of unusual Earth pollinators, which became known as the \u0022butterfly effect.\u0022}}",
