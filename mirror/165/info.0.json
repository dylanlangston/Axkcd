The turn signals of both cars seem to be blinking at the same time.]]\nPerson in Street: Hey, our turn signals are in sync!\nPerson in Car: What the hell?\nPerson in Street: Usually they\u0027re at least a little off. But I\u0027ve been watching like 30 seconds and haven\u0027t seen any beat frequency!\nPerson in Car: Who are you?\nPerson in Street: You know, from the beat frequency you can tell the difference in timing of the two signals.\nPerson in Car: ...\nPerson in Street: But ours are the same!\nPerson in Car: ...\nPerson in Street: So, wanna hang out later?\n{{Alt: I\u0027m not very good at meeting people.}}",
