The gap is indicated with an arrow.]]\n[[The same couple is shown again, cuddling snugly on the mattress.]]\n\n[[A man and woman are giving a presentation to another person. The man has a pointer and a clicker for the slides which are projected on the screen next to him.]]\nListener: Oh man, that\u0027s ALWAYS bothered me.\nListener: I want one.\n\nListener: Although ... so the lower arms just sort of dangle?\nListener: What do you do with them?\n\nMan: It was a bit awkward.\nClicker: \u003C\u003Cclick\u003E\u003E\nWoman: Then we had a second breakthrough.\n\n[[The couple is shown again on the cuddle mattress, this time in more detail and facing the tops of their heads.
