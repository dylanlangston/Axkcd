Writing on the box says \u0022Superintelligent AI - do not open.\u0022}}\nSG: A superintelligent AI can convince anyone of anything, so if it can talk to us, there\u0027s no way we could keep it contained.\n\n[[Black Hat Guy reaches down toward the box.]]\nSG: It can always convince us to let it out of the box.\nBH: Cool. Let\u0027s open it. \n\n[[Black Hat picks up and opens the box. A little glowy ball comes out of it.]]\nSG: --\nNO, WAIT!!\n\n\n[[The two stare up at it, Black Hat is still holding the box..]]\nAI: (in a wavy speech bubble filled with outer space, in a white serif font) hey. i liked that box. put me back.\nBH: No.\n\n[[The background from the previous panel\u0027s speech bubble (black with stars) expands to fill the whole panel, and the AI glows brightly. Stick Guy puts his hands up to shield his face. Black Hat opens the box.]]\nAI: (in big white block letters) LET ME BACK INTO THE BOX\nBH: AAA! OK!!!\n\n[[The panel returns to normal as the AI flies back down into the box.]]\n*shoop*\n\n[[Black Hat puts the box back down on the floor and both stare at it.]]\n\n{{Title text: I\u0027m working to bring about a superintelligent AI that will eternally torment everyone who failed to make fun of the Roko\u0027s Basilisk people.}}",
