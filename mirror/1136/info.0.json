Guess this means seven more years of the illusion that my actions somehow influence the indifferent hand of probability which governs our lives.\n\n[[Black hat guy stares at the shards of glass on the floor.]]\n\nChap: Plus like half an hour of sweeping.\nBlack Hat: No, I think I\u0027ll leave it.\nChap: You\u0027ll get glass in your feet.\n\n[[Black hat guy holds up a shard of glass, looks at it.]]\nBlack Hat: Eccles. 9:2 - All things come alike to all: To the clean, and to the unclean.\nBlack Hat: My fate is as these shards.\nChap: Dude, chill, it\u0027s just a vanity mirror.\nBlack Hat: \nAll\n is vanity mirrors.\n\n{{Title text: \u0027I see you\u0027re in this mood again.\u0027 \u0027I am always in this mood.\u0027}}",
