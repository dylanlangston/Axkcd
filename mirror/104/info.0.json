White text is in the black sections.]]\nYou were afraid that you would disappear, that you would be lost and forgotten.\nI held you tight against the dark and said that I would always come for you.\nThen one day it happened. You were torn from my arms and vanished from this world.\nMaybe you don\u0027t remember my promise. But I meant every word.\nI hope you\u0027re not afraid, wherever you are.\nYou don\u0027t need to be.\nI\u0027m not.\nI will find you.\n{{title-text: I\u0027m like the Terminator, except with love!}}",
