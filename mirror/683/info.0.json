Lights and screens are shining, and there\u0027s a hamster ball and a Newton\u0027s cradle on a shelf behind them.]]\n\n[[There\u0027s a glowing sample next to a rat in a cage. One of the scientists is holding a glowing implement; she has another rat in her hand and one on her head. The other scientist is on the phone.]]\nCaged Rat: Squeak!\n\n[[One of the scientists pulls levers on another machine, which is shooting some kind of ray downwards a a sample.]]\n\n[[The other scientist is operating a machine with a scope, flasks, coils, and bubbles.]]\nScientist (in panel): Paint flecks from the killer\u0027s clothing match an antimatter factory in Belgrade!\nScientist (off panel): Let\u0027s go!\n\nActual Science Montage\n\n[[Two scientists in lab coats and goggles place a sample into a machine. There\u0027s a clock on the wall.]]\n\n[[Time has passed.]]\nMachine: \u003C\u003C...whirrrrrr...\u003E\u003E\n\n[[Time has passed.
