Beret Guy\u0027s phone seems a bit bigger.]]\nFigure: Where\u0027d you get a big iPhone? I didn\u0027t think they were out yet. \nBeret guy: It\u0027s my regular one. It\u0027s just dying. \n\n[[His phone is now the size of a tablet.]]\nBeret guy: As it consumes its battery, it heats up and expands. Soon it will swell to enormous size, engulfing us both. \n\n[[His phone is now the size of a badger.]]\nBeret guy: Then it will collapse in a violent explosion! \nFigure: ... Do you want to borrow my charger? \nBeret guy: That would only make it run out faster! \n\n{{Title text: When it explodes, it will cast off its outer layers, leaving behind nothing but a slowly fading PalmPilot, calculator, or two-way pager.}}",
