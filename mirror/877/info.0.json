They are interrupted by an off-panel shout.]]\nHuman: The problem with scientists is that you take the wonder and beauty out of everything by trying to analyze it.\nShout: Dude!\n\n[[A Scientist runs across the panel, carrying a microscope and a slime mold.]]\nScientist: My plasmoidal slime molds have heightened pigment production! Check out that yellow color! That actually makes them zinc-resistatn. Amazing, huh?\n\n[[The slime mold is proferred to the same human who was speaking earlier.  The close up hides the Scientist\u0027s face.]]\nHuman: It looks like dog barf.\nScientist: Hah, yeah! F. Septica is nicknamed \u0022dog vomit slime mold.\u0022  Cool, huh?  Check out my slides!\n\n[[The scientist has set down the microscope on the floor of the panel, and the slime mold is jiggling.]]\nHuman: Okay, never mind: What\u0027s wrong with scientists is that you \ndo\n see wonder and beauty in everything.\nHuman: Oh God, it\u0027s \nmoving!\n\nScientist: It wants to hug you! So cute!\n\n{{Title text: The best hugs are probably from hagfish, which can extrude microscopic filaments that convert a huge volume of water around them to slime in seconds. Instant cozy blanket!}}",
