They try to predict which route will be faster, but aren\u0027t always right.\n\nInstead of just planning, my new app lets you send \u0022ghost\u0022 versions of you along different routes, simulating their travel using the real-time data.\n\nThat way, you can see which route turned out to be faster in practice. You can also race your past selves.\n\n[[Soon: Person dashing out of a taxi, twenty feet behind a ghost.]]\nUgh, lost to the bike ghost AGAIN.\n\n[[Person carrying briefcase is on wrong side of door. On the other side, wife is standing with ghost also carrying briefcase. ]]\nPerson: Hey, my key won\u0027t work.\nWife: I\u0027m sorry, but we\u0027ve decided to replace you.
