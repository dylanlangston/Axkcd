The person has brought along a head of cabbage, a goat, and a wolf.]]\nProblem: The boat only holds two, but you can\u0027t leave the goat with the cabbage or the wolf with the goat.\n\n[[The wolf looks curiously at the lumpy bally that\u0027s been left behind while the person goes off with the goat]]\nSolution: 1. Take the goat across\n\n[[The goat remains tied up on the far side.  The wolf watches the person come back]]\n2. Return alone.\n\n[[The wolf thinks \u0022aww no mo bally\u0022 as the person goes off]]\n3. Take the cabbage across. \n\n4. Leave the wolf.  Why did you have a wolf?\n[[The wolf goes off all sad-like]]\n\n\n{{Title text: Or a cabbage, for that matter. The goat makes sense. Goats are fine.}}",
