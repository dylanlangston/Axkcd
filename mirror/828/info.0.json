A friend stands by.]]\nMan: I\u0027m sick and I\u0027m scared.\nFriend: Well, remember - having a good attitude is the most important thing. Think positively and you\u0027ll get better.\n\n[[Darkness surrounds the man on the bed. The friend is off-screen.]]\nMan: So if I\u0027m sad or afraid or feel like crap sometimes, then...\nFriend: ...then if you don\u0027t recover, it will be \nyour fault.\n\n\n[[The man on the bed clutches his hands to his face and leans back.]]\nMan: Well that makes me feel even worse.\nFriend: See? You\u0027re doing this to yourself.\nMan: No!\nFriend: Stop it!\nMan: Argh!\n\n[[Close up on the man, holding up his hand, pointing to himself.]]\nMan: Okay, you know what? Screw this. My attitude isn\u0027t my problem. -- My \ndisease\n is my problem, and I\u0027m treating it. -- I\u0027m going to be glum and depressed and pessimistic some days, and I\u0027m going to \nget better anyway.\n\n\n[[The man sits on the edge of the bed, his friend still standing in front of him.]]\nMan: Wait, that ended up sounding optimistic.\nFriend: I guess you suck at pessimism.\nMan: Maybe I\u0027ll be better at it tomorrow.\n\n{{Title text: Having a positive attitude is almost tautologically good for your mental health, and extreme stress can hurt your immune system, but that doesn\u0027t mean you should feel like shit for feeling like shit.}}",
