The wire leads to an outlet in the wall next to where the Hat Man sits at a desk with a computer. Another wire leads from that outlet to the Hat Man\u0027s computer.]]\nMan: Huh? I always thought \u0022The Cloud\u0022 was a huge, amorphous network of servers somewhere.\nHat Man: Yeah, but everyone buys server time from everyone else. In the end, they\u0027re all getting it here.\n\n[[A close-up of Hat Man.]]\nMan (off-screen): How? You\u0027re on a \ncable\n modem.\nHat Man: There\u0027s a lot of caching.\n\n[[A close-up of the man, looking down at the tower at his feet.]]\nMan: Should the cord be stretched across the room like this?\nHat Man (off-screen): Of course. It has to reach the server, and the server is over there.\n\n[[The man turns back to the Hat Man, still sitting at the computer.]]\nMan: What if someone trips on it?\nHat Man: Who would want to do that? It sounds unpleasant.\nMan: Uh. Sometimes people do stuff by accident.\nHat Man: I don\u0027t think I know anybody like that.\n\n{{Title text: There\u0027s planned downtime every night when we turn on the Roomba and it runs over the cord.}}",
