Does Bernanke own a crossbow?\n[[Background is a graph, with x-axis labeled \u0022Length of Conversation\u0022 and y-axis labeled \u0022How Often This Happens\u0022.  The graph looks parabolic towards the left-hand side, but as x approaches infinity, y approaches zero.  A vertical dashed line runs through the graph, slightly to the right of the peak of the graph.  To the right of the dashed line there is an arrow pointing to the right that is labeled \u0022Awkward Zone\u0022.  The x-axis has a broken scale, and to the right of the break there is a very small increase in the graph that is parenthetically labeled \u0022My Second Relationship\u0022.]]\n{{title text: He continued, \u0027Okay, Bernanke is uncontaminated.
