Defy all rules of composition.\nWhat are you suggesting?\nMaybe there is a god, but he\u0027s a real art lover.\nThis is why I don\u0027t go out in public with you.\n{{Alt text: So he\u0027s saying that God thought Hitler\u0027s art was so bad that the Holocaust was an acceptable alternative.  It\u0027s no secret that the hat guy is closely based on Aram, from Men in Hats.}}",
