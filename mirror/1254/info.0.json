I emailed you, and you replied on Skype and mentioned that the email \u0022woke you up.\u0022 \n\nFigure: You\u0027re very responsive - I just have no sense of how you use technology. \n\n[[An owl flies into the panel.]]\nFigure: ?!?\n\n[[The owl perches on the figure\u0027s head. It has delivered a note to the figure.]]\nNote: did you try to call me? use my google voice number next time. \n\n{{Title text: If you call my regular number, it just goes to my pager.}}",
