I\u0027m pretty sure I stopped growing up in my teens and have been faking ever since.\n\nMan #2: For god\u0027s sake, you\u0027re entrusting me with a \nbuilding\n. I still make LEGO buildings sometimes.\n\nMan #1: Sir, does any of this impact your fulfillment of the lease terms?\nMan #2: I don\u0027t know what you just said because I was thinking about Batman.\n\n{{Title text: You should talk to the girl down the hall; I think you\u0027d like her.
