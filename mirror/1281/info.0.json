A vertical line at 2013 is marked \u0027today\u0027. The first measurement, \u0027number of people in the world\u0027 begins at 1980 at just under 4 billion and steadily increases to today\u0027s 7 billion. The second measurement is a gradual incline marked \u0027number of LEGO people in the world\u0027, which begins just before 1980 at 0, gets to around 2 billion by the mid-90s, and increases to around 5.5 billion today. Both figures are projected past today\u0027s measurements as dashed lines and meet at a point in 2019.]]\nBy 2019, humans will be outnumbered. \n\n{{Title text: The LEGO Group is already the world\u0027s largest tire manufacturer.}}",
