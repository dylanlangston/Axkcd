They\u0027re both 19 inches, with similar pitches.\nWoman: Uh oh.\n\n[[The woman has turned round in her chair to look at black hat guy.]]\nBlack hat guy: I\u0027m pleased to announce that today, for a few hours, Google led the world in datacenter honey production. Until their security people kicked me out.\n\n[[The woman turns back to her computer, while black hat guy walks off.]]\nWoman: I\u0027m sorry your beekeeping career ended so quickly.\nBlack hat guy: I\u0027ll find a new datacentre. Turns out most colocation TOSes don\u0027t mention beehives.\nWoman: I suspect that will soon change.\n\n{{Title text: There\u0027s also nothing in the TOSes that says you can\u0027t let a dog play baseball in the server room!}}",
