Some classic rock like Boston, but then of course Queen and Bowie, Joan Jett...\nFemale: Definitely, we need more of those sounds.\nMale: But there\u0027s some great newer stuff too, like Franz Ferdinand, The Donnas, and Audioslave.\nFemale: Sometimes they\u0027re a little much for me. I go more for things like The Arcade Fire, sometimes mixing some electronic sounds like Postal Service.\nMale: Oh yeah\u00E2\u0080\u0094have you ever checked out Freezepop?\nFemale: Mhm! Synth pop can be fun, but at the same time, I agree that sometimes you just need to blast some Metallica.\nMale: Who?\nFemale: ...Metallica.\nMale: Are they new?\nNarrator: I sound pretty knowledgeable about music until people figure out that I\u0027m just naming bands from Guitar Hero.\n{{title text: When Guitar Hero 2 comes out I\u0027ll have fresh conversational material for MONTHS.}}",
