The part of the countdown we can see reads \u00220002409\u0022.]]\nMan: What\u0027s that? \nHat guy: Countdown. \n\n[[The countdown now reads \u00220002400\u0022.]]\nMan: To what? \nHat guy: Supervolcano, I think. I forget which one.\n\n[[The countdown now reads \u00220002396\u0022.]]\n\n[[The countdown now reads \u00220002382\u0022.]]\nMan: Maybe we should move that picture? \nHat guy: Too hard to reach.
