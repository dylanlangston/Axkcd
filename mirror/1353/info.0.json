  "transcript": "[[Two people are walking along, one is looking at her phone.]]\nPerson 1: Heartbleed must be the worst web security lapse ever.\nPerson 2: Worst so far. Give us time.\n\n[[Still walking, first person is now holding her phone at her side.]]\nPerson 1: I mean, this bg isn\u0027t just broken encryption. It lets website visitors make a server dispense random memory contents.\n\n[[They stop walking and face each other.]]\nPerson 1: It\u0027s not just keys. It\u0027s traffic data. Emails. Passwords. Erotic fanfiction.\nPerson 2: Is \neverything\n compromised?\n\n[[They begin walking again.]]\nPerson 1: Well, the attack is limited to data stored in computer memory.\nPerson 2: So paper is safe. And clay tablets.\nPerson 1: Our imaginations, too.\nPerson 2: See, we\u0027ll be fine.\n\n{{Title text: I looked at some of the data dumps from vulnerable sites, and it was ... bad. I saw emails, passwords, password hints. SSL keys and session cookies. Important servers brimming with visitor IPs. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, c-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannh\u00E4user Gate. I should probably patch OpenSSL.}}",
