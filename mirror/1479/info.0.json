The hair\u0027d one sits at the controls, and the bald one hovers impatiently behind.]]\nHair\u0027d character: Wait, why can\u0027t I click anywhere?\nBald character: I don\u0027t... ugh, it opened a dialog box offscreen.\nHair\u0027d character: Why is that even POSSIBLE?\nBald character: It really shouldn\u0027t be. But you can fix it by changing your screen resolution to trigger a window cleanup.\nHair\u0027d character: SERIOUSLY?\nBald character: I know, I know...\n\nCaption: To be honest, I can\u0027t WAIT for the day when all my stupid computer knowledge becomes obsolete.\n\n{{Title text: \u0022Oh, you\u0027re using their Chrome APP, not their Chrome EXTENSION.
