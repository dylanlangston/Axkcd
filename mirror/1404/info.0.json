Let me get this straight - they pumped 20 kilowatts into a box under ambient conditions... and it only twitched a *little*?\nFigure: Yeah. \n\n[[The figures continue walking. We see them in silhouette.]]\nWoman: *That\u0027s* surprising. If you umped 20 kilowatts into *me*, I\u0027d twitch a *lot*. \nFigure: But you\u0027re not pushing on the quantum vacuum.\nWoman: I *might* be. I do a lot of things. \nFigure: I guess we can\u0027t be sure. \n\n{{Title text: I don\u0027t understand the things you do, and you therefore may represent an interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma.}}",
