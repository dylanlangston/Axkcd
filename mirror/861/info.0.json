I\u0027m game.\nGirl, on phone: But you said you didn\u0027t want to \u0022get hooked and spend days on end moving virtual cubes around while sitting motionless.\u0022 What changed?\n\nGuy, on phone: I\u0027m having my wisdom teeth out, and I\u0027ll be useless and doped up on painkillers for the next few days, so that actually sounds like the perfect distraction.\nGirl, on phone: Oh. I\u0027ll set you up on our server!\n\n72 hours later...\n[[Girl sitting at computer.]]\nGirl, on phone: Hey -- starting to feel better? Enjoying the game? Let\u0027s see what you\u0027ve... What the hell? Where IS everything?\n\n[[View of a Minecraft screen showing a vast empty expanse of land.]]\nGirl, offscreen: ...
