This won\u0027t let your brain control USB devices, you know.\nMan: Sure -- I just want the hardware.\n\nMan: The rest is software; I\u0027m sure there will be a project to patch together support eventually.\nSurgeon: Ah -- you\u0027re a Linux user, I see.\nMan: Yeah, how\u0027d you know?\n\n{{Title text: Damn.
