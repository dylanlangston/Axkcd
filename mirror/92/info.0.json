It\u0027s like a secret. I always hope that I\u0027ll find someone else quietly hiding from sleep, and we\u0027ll see each other and sit and talk. I guess this is a bad place to meet people. I wish it weren\u0027t.\n[[Guy goes into the house, brushes his teeth, and leaves the house again.]]\n[[Guy is at a club, disco balls in the ceiling and a giant woofer. Many people are dancing around him.]]\n{{Title Text: Sometimes, I sit on top of parking decks and watch the sun rise.  I feel like I should have a guitar or something.}}",
