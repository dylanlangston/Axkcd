You\u0027re citing .Net ppages with black backgrounds and like 20 fonts each.\n\nPerson 2, using a laptop on a desk: It\u0027s sad how you buy into the official story so unquestioningly.  Guess some people prefer to stay asleep.\n\nPerson 1: Watch closely - I\u0027m about to win this argument.\nPerson 2, responding electronically: how?\n\nPerson 1: By *going down a waterslide*. [[The person is sitting at the very top of a waterslide preparing to descend]]\n\nPerson 2: So? what does that prove?\n\nPerson 1: Wheeee..\n\nPerson 2: You didn\u0027t win the argument!\n\nPerson 1: ...eeee \u003C\u003Csploosh\u003E\u003E\n\n{{Title text: Really, the comforting side in most conspiracy theory arguments is the one claiming that anyone who\u0027s in power has any plan at all.}}",
