Cash?\n\n((Text above half-sized panel.))\nYeah. When there\u0027s a news story about a study overturning all of physics, i used to urge caution, remind people that experts aren\u0027t all stupid, and end up in pointless arguments about Galileo.\n\n((Half-height panel.))\n[[Man sitting on chair, looking down at laptop in his lap. Books and things are on a desk in front of him.]]\nMan: No, this isn\u0027t \nabout\n whether relativity exists. If it didn\u0027t, your GPS wouldn\u0027t work. -- What do you mean, \u0022science thought police\u0022? Have you seen our budget? We couldn\u0027t \nbegin\n to afford our own thought police.\n\n[[Two talking people again.]]\nPerson 1: That sounds miserable and unfulfilling.\nPerson 2: Yup. So I gave up, and now I just find excited believers and bet them $200 each that the new result won\u0027t pan out.\n\n[[Same as last panel.]]\nPerson 1: That\u0027s mean.\nPerson 2: It provides a good income, and if I\u0027m ever wrong, I\u0027ll be too excited about the new physics to notice the loss.\n\n{{Title text: I can\u0027t speak to the paper\u0027s scientific merits, but it\u0027s really cool how on page 10 you can see that their reference GPS beacon is sensitive enough to pick up continental drift under the detector (interrupted halfway through by an earthquake).}}",
