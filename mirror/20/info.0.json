You don\u0027t seriously think they could let your ferret fly, right?\nGuy: I... of course not.\nGuy: That would be pretty dumb. It\u0027s just, uh... ...a Halloween costume.\nFriend: oh, okay.\nFriend: Besides, who would want a pet to fly anyway?\nGuy: Yeah. Pretty lame, huh?\nFriend: Anyway, let\u0027s go play video games.\n[[Friend leaves]]\n[[Friend is gone, and Guy is looking at ferret]]\n[[Guy imagines ferret flying over the ocean near the beach using his makeshift wings]]\n{{title text: My brother had a ferret he loved which died since I drew this strip.
