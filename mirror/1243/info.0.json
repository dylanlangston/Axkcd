He\u0027s talking to a figure standing behind him.]]\nFigure: They said on the news that they found a giant ring lying in a field outside Chicago. Strung with some kind of superstrong mesh. \nBlack hat guy: Mhm? \n\nFigure: Then they found a 260-mile long shaft connected to the ring, running from Chicago to St. Louis. In St. Louis they found a gigantic winch. \nBlack hat guy: Did they. \n\nFigure: It sounds kind of like... ...a butterfly net. \n\nFigure: ... Are you planning to catch the International Space Station?\nBlack hat guy: I\u0027m planning to catch *an* international space station. Not sayin\u0027 which. \n\n{{Title text: It\u0027s going in A collection of satellites skewered with pins and mounted in display boxes. Not necessarily MY collection.}}",
