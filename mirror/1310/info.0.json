They read:\nWeak: Every odd number greather than 5 is the sum of three primes.\nStrong: Every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.\nVery weak: Every number greater than 7 is the sum of two other numbers.\nVery strong: Every odd number is prime.\nExtremely weak: Numbers just \nkeep going\n.\nExtremely strong: There are no numbers above 7.\n\n{{Title text: The weak twin primes conjecture states that there are infinitely many pairs of primes. The strong twin primes conjecture states that every prime p has a twin prime (p\u002B2), although (p\u002B2) may not look prime at first. The tautological prime conjecture states that the tautological prime conjecture is true.}}",
