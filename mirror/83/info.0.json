He is looking at a TV on the floor connected to a game console, also on the floor.]]\nGirl: Can you pause for a moment and help me with something?\nMan: You know, our love is like a katamari.  We travel along, rolling up more and more of the world into our shared experience, taking it and making it our own.\nGirl: I, you... wow.  Geekiness aside, that was actually incredibly sweet.\nMan: The clutter of everyday life, with a simple core to tie it together, eventually becomes something grand as the world itself.\n[[A rainbow extends outward from the TV, with \u0022ROYAL RAINBOW!\u0022 above it.]]\nGirl: Okay, also sweet, but now I\u0027m wondering if you could possibly get any gayer.\n{{alt text: As the King of All Cosmos remarked, \u0027Is it that it\u0027s fun, or that it lets you forget yourself?\u0027}}",
