You\u0027re being stalked by an unstoppable robotic assassin!\n\n[[We see a close-up of the figure.]]\nFigure: Of course, in a sense, we\u0027re *all* being stalked by an unstoppable robot. A robot called *time*.\n\n[[The figure looks at a ticking clock on the wall.]]\nFigure: I see it in the mirror. I see wrinkles, grey hairs. I hear its metallic footsteps in the relentless rhythm of the ticking clock. \n\n[[We pan back out to see both figures.]]\nFigure: Anyway, uhh\u0096 come with me if you want to live for a while. You\u0027ll still die eventually. We all will.\n\n{{Title text: NO FATE BUT THE NARRATIVES WE IMPOSE ON LIFE\u0027S RANDOM CHAOS TO DISTRACT OURSELVES FROM OUR EXISTENTIAL PLIGHT}}",
