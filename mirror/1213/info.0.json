It is not easy to see, but the numbers show a large \u002742\u0027 in the center. The 4 and the 2 are made up of different numbers.]]\nIf you can see one big number but not the other, you have synesthesia \nand\n colorblindness.\n\n{{Title text: If you see two numbers but they\u0027re both the same and you have to squint to read them, you have synesthesia, colorblindness, diplopia, and myopia.}}",
