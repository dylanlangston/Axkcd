Yeah, there\u0027s a bunch of berylliums.\nScienceer: How do you know?\n\n[[Beret picks up the sample.]]\nBeret: Look at it! See? Tons of oxygens and silicons, a few irons, but definitely some berylliums, too! Can\u0027t you see them?\n\nScienceer: No, I can\u0027t see a list of the atoms in a thing by looking.\nBeret: How do you tell what things are?\n\nScienceer: This is ridiculous. Look at me. What do you see?\nBeret: You have tons of metal in your face. Lots of fillings, I guess?\n\nScienceer: What\u0027s WRONG with you?\n[[Beret looks worriedly at own wrist.]]\nBeret: Too many zincs? I\u0027ve always worried I had too much zinc and everyone thought I was weird.\n\n{{Title text: When I was little I had trouble telling my dad apart form the dog.
