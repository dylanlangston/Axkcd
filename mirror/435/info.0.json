They stand on a scale of purity with the left end representing less purity and the right representing more purity. They appear in this order, from left to right: Sociology, Psychology, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics. The mathematician stands much further to the right than any other field.]]\nPsychologist: Sociology is just applied Psychology.\nBiologist: Psychology is just applied Biology.\nChemist: Biology is just applied Chemistry\nPhysicist: Which is just applied Physics. It\u0027s nice to be on top.\nMathematician: Oh, hey, I didn\u0027t see you guys all the way over there.\n{{Alt-text: On the other hand, physicists like to say physics is to math as sex is to masturbation.}}",
