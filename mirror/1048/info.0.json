There is a wedge of Joss Whedon that tapers out starting from 2006 to around mid 2007.  There is a noticeable increase in \u0022Politics\u0022 around fall, 2008 that tapers off sharply afterwards and appears again in the second half on 2010, until..\n\nAround approximately September 2010, everything else is compressed into a tiny fraction of around 2-3%.
