They think a series of thoughts, each of which are crossed out in the thought bubble.]]\nPerson (thinking): Wow, it\u0027s getting so big! Unlike most babies, which stay the same size forever.\nHi! I\u0027m talking to a baby!\nWhat brand is it?\nWow, definitely much smaller than a regular person!\nYou sure did make that.\n4\n5 stars, Great baby.\nIt doesn\u0027t really look like you since you\u0027re not a baby.\nSo do they learn words one at a tie alphabetically or can you pick the order or what?\nI hope it does a good job.\nPerson (says aloud): Wow, that\u0027s a really cool baby!\nPerson (thinks): Dammit.\n\nI can never figure out what to say to babies.\n{{Title text: Does it get taller first and then widen, or does it reach full width before getting taller, or alternate, or what?}}",
