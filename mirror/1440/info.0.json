The woman points at the sky.]]\nWoman: To think... we\u0027re seeing light that left those geese centuries ago. By now, they could be long dead.\n\n[[The figure props himself up to turn around and look at her.]]\nFigure: ... What? They\u0027re a few hundred yards away. I hear them honking.\nWoman: Ah, yes. You\u0027re hearing how they once sounded.\nFigure: You\u0027re very weird.\nWoman: Or I was, long ago...\n\n{{Title text: Anyway, that\u0027s a common misconception. Geese live for a long time; all the ones we can see will probably keep flying around for billions of years before they explode.}}",
