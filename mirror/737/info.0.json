Waves of stink are rising from it.]]\nPerson 1: Oh God, how old is this yogurt in your fridge?\n[[Someone speaks from off-panel.]]\nPerson 2: What\u0027s hte expiration date?\n\n[[The first person holds up the cup to look at the bottom.]]\nPerson 1: May 12th, but there\u0027s no year.\n[[From off-panel again.]]\nIt\u0027s May 7th.  So it\u0027s fine.\n\n[[Now the second person is on panel, and the first speaks from off-panel.  The second person is sitting down working on a laptop.]]\nPerson 1:I\u0027m not sure.  When it was packaged, was civilization using the Gregorian or Julian calendar?\nPerson 2: Okay, I\u0027ll throw it out.\nPerson 1: No, it might still be good!\n\n{{Title text: I am firmly of the opinion that if something doesn\u0027t have a year on it, every time the expiration date rolls around it is good again for the two weeks preceeding that date.}}",
