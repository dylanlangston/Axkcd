They\u0027ve been passed on and meant a lot.\nRandall: I like drawing, and might find time for it in the coming weeks, but I\u0027m not going to push myself to stick to a schedule.\nRandall: However, between my stacks of notebooks, scanner, and supportive sysadmin, I should at least have something interesting to share with yyou in this space each M\nW\nF.\nRandall: \u003C3\n\n{{Title text: \u003C3 If there\u0027s anything you can do, I\u0027ll let you know.
