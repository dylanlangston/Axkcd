In the morning, I tell myself I can\u0027t control my dreams, but there\u0027s a part of me that doesn\u0027t want them to stop.\nGuy: And honestly, waking up would be a lot easier if your mom didn\u0027t look so much like you.\nGuy: There\u0027s always that moment of confusion.\n{{title-text: But then she does that thing with her tongue and I remember why I left you.}}",
