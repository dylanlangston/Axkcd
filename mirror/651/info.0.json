A guard is holding an open backpack and a bottle of water, and the man is arguing with him.]]\nMan: But if you\u0027re worried about bombs, why are you letting me keep my laptop batteries? If I overvolted them and breached the cells, it would make a sizeable explosion.\nWoman: Oh god.\nMan: It\u0027s okay, dear. In a moment he\u0027ll realize I have a good point and return my water.\n\n{{Title text: A laptop battery contains roughly the stored energy of a hand grenade, and if shorted it ... hey!  You can\u0027t arrest me if I prove your rules inconsistent!}}",
