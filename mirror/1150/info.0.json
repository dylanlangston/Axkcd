And he lets me in to see it whenever I want. \n\n[[We see a handwritten note.]]\nMan #2: But I just got this note from him:\nNote: Dude, in like a month im gonna Craigslist all that shit you left in my garage. Just FYI. -- Chad\n\n[[A close-up of man #2.]]\nMan #2: It\u0027s an *outrage*! This is no way to run a storage business! \nMan #1: Are you paying him to look after your stuff? \n\n[[We see both characters again, as in panel #1.]]\nMan #2: No.\nMan #1: Then what he runs isn\u0027t a storage business.\nMan #2: Well, I\u0027m *this* close to not giving him any more stuff. \nMan #1: That\u0027ll teach him. \n\n{{Title text: I\u0027m gonna call the cops and get Chad arrested for theft, then move all my stuff to the house across the street.
