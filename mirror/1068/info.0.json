It learns from your SMS\nEmail archives what words you use together most often.\n\nPerson 1: Spacebar inserts its best guess. So if I type \u0022The Empi\u0022 and hit space three times, it types \u0022The Empire Strikes Back\u0022.\nPerson 2: What if you mash space in a blank message?\n\nPerson 1: I guess it fills in your most likely first word, then the word that usually follows it..\nPerson 2: So it builds up your \u0022typical\u0022 sentence. Cool! Let\u0027s see yours!\nPerson 1: Uh--\n\nSwiftKey: I\n\nSwiftKey: Am\n\nSwiftKey: So\n\nSwiftKey: Sorry\n\nSwiftKey: That\u0027s\n\nSwiftKey: Never\n\nSwiftKey: Happened\n\nSwiftKey: Before.\n\n{{Title text: Although the Markov chain-style text model is still rudimentary; it recently gave me \u0022Massachusetts Institute of America\u0022. Although I have to admit it sounds prestigious.}}",
