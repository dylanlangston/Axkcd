Gimme a few hours. \nFigure: ... and check whether the photo is of a bird. \nWoman programmer: I\u0027ll need a research team and five years.\nIn CS, it can be hard to explain the difference between the easy and the virtually impossible.\n\n{{Title text: In the 60s, Marvin Minsky assigned a couple of undergrads to spend the summer programming a computer to use a camera to identify objects in a scene. He figured they\u0027d have the problem solved by the end of the summer. Half a century later, we\u0027re still working on it.}}",
