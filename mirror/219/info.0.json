It uses every blanket and cushion in the apartment.\nSecond Girl: Okay, no offense, but this is like that ball pit you made -- Cute, but don\u0027t you worry you\u0027re clinging to childhood games because you\u0027re afraid of change?\nFirst Girl: No. I\u0027m happy to grow up. But I won\u0027t pretend fun things aren\u0027t still fun out of fear of looking silly.\nSecond Girl: But you\u0027re 24 and building blanket forts. How have you changed? What\u0027s adult about that?\nFirst Girl: Well, there\u0027s my boyfriend curled up in the back.\nSecond Girl: ...Ah.\nBoyfriend [[from inside the fort]]:Excuse my shyness.  I\u0027m not exactly dressed.\n{{alt text: Also, we have a fort out in the woods where we stashed that hooker\u0027s body.}}",
