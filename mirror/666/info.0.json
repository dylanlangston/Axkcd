I\u0027ve made a set of silent tools.\nGuy: Why?\nHammer: \u003C\u003Cwhoosh whoosh whoosh\u003E\u003E\n\nHat Guy: Stealth carpentry. Breaking into a house at night and moving windows, adjusting walls, etc.\n[[He takes his silent hammer over to a tool bench with other things on it. Two boxes underneath are labeled \u0022Drills\u0022 and \u0022Non-Drills.\u0022]]\n\nHat Guy, narrating: After a week or so of questioning his own sanity, the owner will stay up to watch the house at night. I\u0027ll make scratching noises in the walls, pipe in knockout gas, move him up to his bed, and never bother him again.\n[[The events he\u0027s describing are shown in two mini-panels below.]]\n\nGuy, off-panel: Nice prank, I guess, but what\u0027s the point?\nHat Guy: Check out the owner\u0027s card, on the table.\nGuy, off-panel: Chair of the American Skeptics Society? Oh, god.\nHat guy: Yeah, this doesn\u0027t end well for him.\n\n{{Title text: I bet he\u0027ll keep quiet for a couple weeks and then-- wait, did you nail a piece of scrap wood to my antique table a moment ago?}}",
