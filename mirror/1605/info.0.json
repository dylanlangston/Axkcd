  "transcript": "White Hat Guy: Biology is largely solved. DNA is the source code for our bodies. Now that gene sequencing is easy, we just have to read it.\nPerson 2: It\u0027s not just \u0022source code\u0022. There\u0027s a ton of feedback and external processing.\n\nPerson 2: But even if it were, DNA is the result of the most aggressive optimization process in the universe, running in parallel at every energy level, in every living thing, for four billion years.\nWhite Hat Guy: It\u0027s still just code.\n[[White Hat Guy sits down at a desk with a laptop]]\n\nPerson 2: Ok, try opening google.com and clicking \u0022view source\u0022.\nWhite Hat Guy: Ok, I- ...oh my god.\nPerson 2: That\u0027s just a few years of optimization by Google devs.  DNA is thousands of times longer and way, *way* worse.\nWhite Hat Guy: Wow, biology is *impossible*.\n\n{{Title text: Researchers just found the gene responsible for mistakenly thinking we\u0027ve found the gene for specific things. It\u0027s the region between the start and the end of every chromosome, plus a few segments in our mitochondria.}}",
