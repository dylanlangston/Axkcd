Keep shooting and never stop. \n\n[[The moon is now almost entirely in-frame now.]]\nWoman: Someday, one of us will destroy that stupid skycircle. And- ... What? What are you all-\n\n[[The moon is now in frame, lurking ominously in the background.]]\nWoman: ... It\u0027s right behind me, isn\u0027t it? Shit.
