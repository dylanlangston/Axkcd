I live in a world of moral absolutes and racist undertones.\nMartin: Jinx!\nNarrator: It startled me when characters mentioned Satan.\nRedwall: \u0022By Satan\u0027s whiskers...\u0022\nRedwall mentions God, Jesus 0 times.\nRedwall mentions Satan, The Devil 4 times.\nNarrator: Harry Potter protesters, take note.\nNarrator: Even as a kid this bothered me: Why does everyone leave critical secret messages as simple riddles? It\u0027s silly to assume the intended recipient will be the only one to find and solve them.
