If you miss a turn, forget an appointment, or give someone inaccurate information, they alert you.\nWoman, on the phone: I\u0027ll be there in five.\nDrone: WRONG!\nWoman: Augh!\n\nGuy: That sounds annoying. Who would pay for that?\nHat Guy: Huh? Nobody pays. I\u0027m just making these and releasing them.\n\nGuy: That\u0027s not a business. You\u0027re just yelling at strangers from the sky.\nGuy: A business has to make money somehow.\nDrone: WRONG!\nGuy: Augh!!\n\n{{Title text: It ships with a version of Google Now that alerts you when it\u0027s too late to leave for your appointments.}}",
