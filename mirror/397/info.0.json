Everything else is bookkeeping.\nZF: By teaching people to hold their beliefs up to experiment, Mythbusters is doing more to drag humanity out of the unscientific darkness than a thousand lessons in rigor. Show them some love.\nZF: Anyway, back to zombie stuff.  I hunger for BRAAAAAIIINNS!\nGuy: Try the physics lab next door.\nZF: I said _brains_.  All they\u0027ve got are string theorists.",
