You can stay up until you\u0027re exhausted every day and then spend a full 9 hours asleep each night!\nSecond Man: But how much time can I spend doing your mom?\nFirst Man: You? I\u0027m guessing three or four minutes, tops.\nSecond Man: ...Well played.\n{{title text: Small print: this schedule will eventually drive one stark raving mad.}}",
