If we\u0027ve done our math right, this test will unleash heaven\u0027s fire and make us as gods.\n\nMiddle figure: But it\u0027s possible we made a mistake, and the heat will ignite the atmosphere, destroying the planet in a cleansing conflagration.\n\nLeft figure: Wow. Um. Question: Just to double-check - although I\u0027m 99% sure -\n\nLeft figure: Is it \u0022Soh cah toa\u0022 or \u0022coh sah toa\u0022?\n\nMiddle figure: Oh, for the love of... can someone redo Steve\u0027s work?\n\nRight figure: I don\u0027t want to do the test anymore.\n\n{{Title text: The test didn\u0027t (spoiler alert) destroy the world, but the fact that they were even doing those calculations makes theirs the coolest jobs ever.}}",
