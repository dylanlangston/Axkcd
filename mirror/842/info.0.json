It\u0027s safer that way.\n\nNarration: Six years later I found a piece of paper in the street with an address on it.  The next day I found a can of kerosene in my garage that I\u0027m sure I never bought.\n[[The panel represents these actions by highlighting the mentioned objects in a world of gray.]]\n\nNarration: I didn\u0027t know whose house it was.  I just knew that I\u0027d been given my orders.
