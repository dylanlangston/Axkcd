That wasn\u0027t true ten years ago.\nWhite Hat Guy: It\u0027s all changing too fast, huh?\nPerson 1: No, too *slowly*.\n\nPerson 1: There\u0027s so much potential here.  These clumsy, poorly-designed toys are *nothing* compared to what lies ahead.\n\n[[Person 1 climbs into a cryogenic chamber]]\nPerson 1: That\u0027s why I\u0027ve worked to develop cryogenic freezing.  I\u0027m gonna skip forward 30 years and use this stuff when it\u0027s *good*.\n\n30 years later..\nSomeone who isn\u0027t Terry: Welcome to the future! Nothing\u0027s changed.\nPerson 1: What? Why??\n\n[[rows of other people waking up out of their own cryogenic chambers]]\nnot Terry: When cryogenic freezing was invented, all the engineers who were excited about the future froze themselves. So there\u0027s been no one building anything new.\n\nnot Terry: But they\u0027re all waking up now!\nPerson 1: Sweet! I\u0027m gonna jump forward to see what they do!\nEngineer 1: Me too!\nEngineer 2: Wait, uh, guys?\n\n\n{{Title text: \u0027Welcome to the future!
