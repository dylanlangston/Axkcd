Inside is Beret Guy.]]\nBeret guy: Hi!\nWoman: Where did you come from?!\nBeret guy: The past! I traveled here in this time machine. \n\nFigure: How did you... get here from the past? \nBeret guy: I dunno. I couldn\u0027t not.\nFigure: But... what did you eat? \nBeret guy: Newspapers, mostly.\n\n[[Beret guy holds up a hammer.]]\nBeret guy: Anyway, I\u0027m here to kill Hitler.\nWoman: But he died long ago!\nBeret guy: Oh, good! That was easy. Want to get sandwiches? Do you still have sandwiches?\n\n{{Title text: Oh no, I changed the future and now I\u0027m disappearing!
