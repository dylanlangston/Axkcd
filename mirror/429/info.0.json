The man is rubbing the woman\u0027s shoulders.]]\nWoman: We\u0027re so lucky to have each other. How did it happen, anyway?\nMan: I, uh... I don\u0027t remember.\n\nWoman: No, really, how did we get together? It\u0027s hard to imagine it happening.\nMan: It does strain the bounds of fantasy...\nWoman: ... Fantasy? That\u0027s it!\n\nWoman: My God, it\u0027s the only explanation: We\u0027re objects in some transient fantasy. We\u0027ll be gone when it ends!\nMan: We\u0027ll lose each other.\nWoman: Oh God.\n\n[[They leap from the bed.  The woman has a flaming torch.]]\nWoman: Well, I\u0027m not going out quietly. I\u0027m burning this fucking world.\nMan: Burn the world!\nWoman: Fire! Fire! Cleanse this hellish place --\n((The thought ends.))\n\n[[The man is puzzled.
