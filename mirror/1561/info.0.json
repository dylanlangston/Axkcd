It shows the commonly known phases of water (ice, liquid, vapor) as well as the more exotic high-pressure phases Ice II, Ice III and Ice V.  As pressure increases, the diagram shows Vanilla Ice (Ice VI) transitioning to David Bowie \u0026 Queen.]]\n\n{{Title text: Vanilla Ice was produced in small quantities for years, but it wasn\u0027t until the 90s that experimenters collaborated to produce a sample that could survive at room temperature for several months. }}",
