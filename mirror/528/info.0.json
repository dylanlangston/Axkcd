I can\u0027t get it to do anything else.\nGirl: There\u0027s no UI?\nGuy: No, just Hitler.\n[[Return to the original scene, except the girl is now scratching her head in confusion]]\nGirl: Did you try Ctrl-Alt-Delete?\nGuy: It just makes Hitler\u0027s eyes flash.\nGirl: Huh.\n[[Scene remains basically the same, except the girl is no longer scratching her head and the guy is no longer typing on the laptop]]\nGirl: Well, it\u0027s better than Vista.\nGuy: True.\n{{title text: Disclaimer: I have not actually tried the beta yet.  I hear it\u0027s quite pleasant and hardly Hitler-y at all.}}",
