The days of each month are arranged in typical monthly calendar format. Some day numbers are larger than others.))\n\n((Due to the 365 different days in a year and individually varying sizes, not every number is mentioned below, only outliers.\n\nJanuary\u0027s 1 is much larger than any other number for that month.\nFeburary\u0027s numbers don\u0027t very all that much, but the 1, 14, and 28 are slightly larger, and the 29 is very small.\nMarch\u0027s 1 and 21 are larger than most of the other numbers.\nApril\u0027s 1 and 15 are somewhat larger than the rest.\nMay\u0027s 1 is significantly larger than any other day in the month.\nJune\u0027s 1 is significantly larger than most of the other days, but 30 is the 2nd largest.\nJuly\u0027s 1 is fairly large, but its 4 is even bigger - about twice the size of most other day\u0027s numbers.\nAugust\u0027s 1 and 15 are both fairly large.\nSeptember\u0027s 1 is somewhat large, but its 11 is by far the biggest number of any in the entire year, 3 times as tall as most other numbers from any month.\nOctober\u0027s 1 is its largest, followed by the 31.\nNovember\u0027s 1 is by far its largest.\nDecember\u0027s 31 is the largest, followed by its 1, 7, and 25.))\n\n\n{{Title text: In months other than September, the 11th is mentioned substantially less often than any other date.
