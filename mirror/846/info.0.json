Hold them there for 90 seconds. [[Panel shows speaker with her hands in a bowl of ice.]]\n\nNow imagine that pain in your jaw, every minute of every hour, bright and searing, washing out everything. You can\u0027t party all night. You can barely stand up. There\u0027s only the pain.\n\nWoman: So, some friendly advice: When you wake up in the morning, before you brush your teeth with a bottle of Jack,\n\nWoman: Brush them with actual toothpaste.\n\n{{Title text: WAKE up in the MORning and my BREATH ain\u0027t PREtty \n and noBODY\u0027S gonna KISS me if my MOUTH smells SHItty \n so I ALways brush my TEETH before I START on the JACK \n sure, my DRINKing\u0027s out of HAND, but I\u0027m conTROLLing my PLAQUE.}}",
