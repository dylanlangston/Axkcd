All subsequent storms will be named using random dictionary words.\nReporter: The newly-formed system in the gulf has been designated \u0022Hurricane Eggbeater\u0022, and we once again pray this is the final storm of this horrible, horrible season.\n\n{{Title text: After exhausting the OED, we started numbering them. When overlapping hurricanes formed at all points on the Earth\u0027s surface, and our scheme was foiled by Cantor diagonalization, we just decided to name them all \u0022Steve\u0022. Your local forecast tomorrow is \u0022Steve\u0022. Good luck.}}",
