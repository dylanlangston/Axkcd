Why?\nWoman: Because we\u0027re grown-ups now, and it\u0027s our turn to decide what that means.\n[[Both vanish into the apartment, balls spilling out into the corridor. A love heart drifts out the door, indicating you-know-what]]\n{{Alt: I\u0027ve looked into this, and I can\u0027t figure out a way to do it cheaply.  And I guess it wouldn\u0027t be sanitary.}}",
