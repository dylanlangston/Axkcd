What is it?\n\nFriend: They\u0027re predators that use aging to kill prey.\nDude: Huh? What do you mean?\n\n[[The panel zooms in on the Friend\u0027s face.  Dude comments from off-panel.]]\nFriend: They live for millenia and use little energy. They can slow down their internal clocks so time speeds past. To hunt, they lock on to some prey, and when it stops moving, they eat it.\nDude (off-panel): But what if the prey doesn\u0027t die?\n\nFriend: I don\u0027t think you quite understand.\nDude: I mean, \nI\u0027m\n not about to die...\nFriend: From the vulture\u0027s viewpoint, everyone says that moments before they do.\n\n{{Title text: In a way, all vultures are Time Vultures; some just have more patience than others.}}",
