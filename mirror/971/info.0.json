That one has some ink on page 78.\n[[Person 1 looks at page 78]]\nPerson 1: A smudge.\nPerson 2: So?\n\nPerson 1: There are no words. You\u0027re not reading. There\u0027s no *story* there.\nPerson 2: Maybe not for you. When I look at those books, I think about all *kinds* of stories.\n\nPerson 2: Reading is about more than what\u0027s on the page. Holding a book prompts my mind to enrich itself.  Frankly, I suspect the book isn\u0027t even necessary.\n\nPerson 2: The whole industry is evil. Greedy publishers and rich authors try to convince us our brains *need* their words.
