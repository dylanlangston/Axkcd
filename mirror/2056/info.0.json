If John Hammond\u0027s lab had been breeding serial killers in creepy masks, I wouldn\u0027t have watched!\u0022 \u0022Wait, are you sure? That could actually be good.\u0022 \u0022Ok, I WOULD watch the scenes where Jeff Goldblum tries to convince a bunch of executives that the park is a bad idea.\u0022",
