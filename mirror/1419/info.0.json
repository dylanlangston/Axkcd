When I\u0027m on the phone I always zone out and pick stuff up and carry it around.\n\n[[SHP at the open fridge door, holding a hammer.]]\nSHP: There\u0027s a hammer in the fridge.\nOOP: Another phone call. I was just fidgeting.\n\n[[SHP walks by four stacks of objects. They consist of books, baseballs, blenders, and other unidentified rectangular objects.]]\nSHP: Did you put all our stuff in weird stacks?\nOOP: Long call. Sorry.\n\n[[SHP goes out to the backyard, looks up at towering monolith.]]\nSHP: ...why is there a giant obelisk in the backyard?\nOOP: Phone again. My bad.\nSHP: It\u0027s carved with prayers to \u0022Ba\u0027al, the Soul-Eater.\u0022\nOOP: Haha! I\u0027m so absentminded.\n\n{{Title text: \u0027No idea what I was thinking! Haha!
