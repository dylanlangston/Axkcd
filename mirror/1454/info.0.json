Six months from now, I\u0027ll be able to fly you here and support us for a while.\n\n[[Same as first panel.]]\nCurly: (typing) It\u0027s a long wait, but we\u0027ll talk every day until then. May this won\u0027t work out, but I want to try. What do you think?\n\n[[She stops typing.]]\nComputer: \nERROR: Your message could not be sent.\n [refresh] \nERROR: No connection.\n\n\n[[A light-haired woman with a ponytail walks in.]]\nCurly: Why can\u0027t I connect?\nPonytail: Someone saw a ridiculous video and said, \u0022That\u0027s it, shut down the internet, we\u0027re done.\u0022 So they did.\n\n[[Looks sadly down at the laptop, hands in her lap.]]\nCurly: ...but...
