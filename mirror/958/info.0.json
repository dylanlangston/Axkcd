  "transcript": "[[Person 1 is sitting at a desk with a laptop, looking at a review website]]\nPerson 1: What\u0027s with this negative review? You *liked* that hotel.\nBlack Hat Man: I have a script that posts a bad review for every hotel I stay at. It reduces demand, which means more vacancies and lower prices next time.\n\nPerson 1: What if the place sucks?\nBlack Hat Man: I change the review to positive to steer other people over there.\n\nPerson 1: You punish companies you like!\nBlack Hat Man: The odds of *my* review putting a hotel out of business are negligible.\nPerson 1: If we all did that the system would collapse!\nBlack Hat Man: Doesn\u0027t affect my logic. Tragedy of the commons.\n\nPerson 1: That\u0027s not even the tragedy of the commons anymore.  That\u0027s the tragedy of you\u0027re a dick.\nBlack Hat Man: If you\u0027re quick with a knife, you\u0027ll find that the invisible hand is made of delicious invisible meat.\n\n{{Title text: \u0027Rating: 1\n5.
